# Efficient Pathfinding Using Enhanced A* with Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance  
🚀 **A comparative study with D* Lite Optimization in Track Planning**

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project presents an improved **A* algorithm** that integrates **dynamic obstacle avoidance**, **cycle prevention**, and **heuristic optimization** to ensure efficient and safe path planning. Additionally, we analyze its relation to **D* Lite**, a widely used algorithm in **real-time trajectory planning**, and propose optimizations for safer navigation in complex environments.  

## 🛠 Key Features  
- **Enhanced A* Algorithm**: Implements adaptive heuristic weighting, cycle reduction, and obstacle-aware node selection.  
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance**: Adjusts paths in real-time when environmental changes occur.  
- **Relation to D* Lite**: Incorporates node priority selection and valuation function improvements inspired by D* Lite research.  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluates A* and D* Lite on different grid maps and obstacle densities.  
- **Simulation & Visualization**: Uses **MATLAB & JavaScript (Leaflet.js)** for visual representation of path planning.
